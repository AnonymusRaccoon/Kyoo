Make sure that the ffmpeg-src directory contains a blank snapshot of the ffmpeg source code.
Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt with admin privilege (using the windows start menu).
Make sure that msys64 is installed and nasm is inside the path
Run: "C:\Program Files\Workspace\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd"  -mingw64 -use-full-path
Verify that items are link inside the new cmd windows (run which cl and run which link)
Then cd to the ffmpeg source file (cd /c/Projects/Kyoo/ffmpeg-src)

Then configure the project: 
./configure --toolchain=msvc --disable-shared
Or, if you want x64 builds use:
./configure --toolchain=msvc --target-os=win64 --arch=x86_64 --disable-shared
If it doesn't work, try this command: I think that the last part are useless.
./configure --toolchain=msvc --disable-shared --enable-static --extra-libs=-static --extra-cflags=--static
Then run "make".
Then run "make install"
The build can be found in the usr/local/include and usr/local/lib subfolders of your msys64 folder.
